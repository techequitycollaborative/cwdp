  "description": [
    "Last year we passed the Pay Transparency for Pay Equity Act (SB 1162) which expands Californiaâ€™s existing pay data reporting requirements to the temporary/contract workforce and strengthens pay transparency for all workers. This means that most California employers are now required to post a salary range on all job postings and report pay data for both full-time employees and contract workers to the state, laying the groundwork for a deeper understanding of our gender and racial pay gaps."
