      "description": "Workers doing similar jobs for the same company should earn the same wages. The federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 requires that people of different genders, race, and other characteristics must earn equal pay for equal work; it should be updated to include language to protect workers doing similar jobs at the same workplace. Amending federal and state Equal Pay Acts is one way to close the wage gap between contract and directly-employed workers."

      "description": "Existing labor laws don't adequately protect contract workers from exploitation or poor working conditions. Contract workers must have written information about their job assignments, clear personnel policies and protections, clear contract terms, formal contract extension and cancellation processes, written and accessible pathways to conversion to direct employment, the ability to speak plainly and openly about their work histories, and more."

      "description": "Measures that create public data and give workers the ability to combat pay disparities are critical. Right now, the relationships between tech companies and contracting agencies are a black box; even the tech companies donâ€™t know exactly how much contract workers earn. Public agencies should require that parent companies report data from their contracting agencies and disrupts the current opaque practice that lets corporations deny responsibility for wage and demographic disparities."
