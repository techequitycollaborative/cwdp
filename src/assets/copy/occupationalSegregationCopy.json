  "description": [
    "Contract and temp workers are more likely to be paid less and have less access to benefits and protections, despite performing similar work to direct employees. They also tend to be Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, women, and nonbinary people. A more diverse workforce with less power and lower wages looks a lot like occupational segregation."
