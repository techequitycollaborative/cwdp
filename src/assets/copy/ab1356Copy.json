    "This year we’re advocating for the Protect Laid Off Workers Act (AB 1356) to expand California’s layoff protection law, the WARN Act, to meet the needs of workers today. It will extend the requirement to give notice of a layoff from 60 to 90 days, ensure that no workers’ safety net is tied up in severance negotiations, and include contract workers in these protections for the first time ever."
