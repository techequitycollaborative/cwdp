    "TechEquity Collaborativeâ€™s Contract Worker Disparity Project investigates how an entire class of tech workers has been locked out of tech's prosperity. Temporary, contract, and contingent workers, who are hired through contracting agencies, are often doing the same work as their directly-employed peers while making less money, receiving fewer benefits, and experiencing career immobility.",
    "The Contract Worker Disparity Project is a comprehensive look at the scale of these inequities. We've used our original findings to build policy solutions and a responsible contracting standard to close this hidden equity gap in tech."
